These maven files are here for historical reasons. 
The native libraries for rxtx have been kept in this project.
They should be moved somewhere else and then these maven
files should be moved too.  If the nar packaging and dependencies
are correctly handled by eclipse then these files will 
not need to be checked out at all.
